HTML Syntax: <tag (event)="code/function"></tag>
Event binding is used on an event such as a mouse click
Functions would typically be called on an Event Binding event
All DOM events that have "on" before it is supported
You just drop the "on" from the event

You can pass events from a child component to any parent component that uses its html selector
For example on click of a button we want to emit an event up to our parent
