HTML Syntax: <tag [property]="attribute"></tag>
You can bind any attribute defined in your component class 
You would use property binding over string interpolation if you want to dynamically update a value

All properties of components are only visible to itself by default
You can expose properties of a component to any component that uses its html selector by using the @Input decorator
You need to import Input from @angular/core also
TypeScript Syntax: @Input() someProperty: string = "hello";

You can also map an alias to a property that you are exposing to parent components
You do so by inputting a name into '' in your @Input('') decorator
TypeScript Syntax: @Input('someAlias') someProperty: string = "hello";
