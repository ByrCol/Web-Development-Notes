You can access your applications files in the webpack folder
From here you can then open any of your scripts and add in breakpoints as you would normally
If you do not have webpack you can go through the bundled .js files and CTRL-F for the code you are looking for
When the application hits your breakpoint it will behave as youd expect and pause the application until you step over etc.
