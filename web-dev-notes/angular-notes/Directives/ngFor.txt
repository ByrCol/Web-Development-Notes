HTML Syntax: <tag *ngFor="let element of array"></tag>
The tag that ngFor is attached to will be duplicated as many times as the ngFor iterates

You can also bind the index of your for loop to a variable with the below syntax
HTML Syntax: <tag *ngFor="let element of array; let i = index"></tag>
index is a reserved keyword which references the array index you are currently iterating over
i is just a random property name and i is what stores your index value so you can reference it through i
