HTML Syntax: <tag [ngClass]="{'key': value}"></tag>
ngClass's object is the following format: className: condition
ngClass is used to apply a CSS class to a HTML tag
Conditionals can be used also
Anything in value of the key value pair will be resolved
No * because it does not alter the DOM

Applying a CSS class if a certain condition is met can be done using the following syntax
<tag [ngClass]="{'cssClassName': arrIndex >= 4 ? true : false}"></tag>
For the above example you will need to bind the arrIndex in your *ngFor but this is only an example
You could use any condition really
