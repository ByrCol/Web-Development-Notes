background-size is a property that allows you to adjust the width and height of a background image(s)
The default behaviour of background images is to tile once they have rendered their size
background-size overrides the default behaviour
You can scale an image up or down, it does not always have to be scaled up in size

Tiling A Background Image
If you had a large image that you wanted to tile 4 times in a 2x2 square
You can set the background-size property in the same class that your background-image is declared in
This squeezes down the containing areas size allowing 4 tiled images
