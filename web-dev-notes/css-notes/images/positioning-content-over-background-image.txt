By default, the content you want to be on top of your background-image will probably be in its own block with the background-image below or above it
To fix this you need to set the contents position to absolute which will take away its own block and have it sitting on top of the background image

The content that you want to be on top of the background-image needs a z-index increment
z-index: 1;
